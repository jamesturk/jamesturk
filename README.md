## Find Me Elsewhere
I have decided to move my work off GitHub. ([why?](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/))

Repositories with lots of collaborators/users have been moved to <https://codeberg.org/jpt/> with issues/etc. intact.
    
See <https://git.unnamed.computer/jpt> for experiments & new work.

<https://jpt.sh> for other things!
